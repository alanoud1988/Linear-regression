**Smart Phone Company**

**Propoal**	

 We are a smart phone company, and we plan to sell a cell phone we manufactured. The market is competitive, and we want to sell our product and dominant the market. We are going to use the available datasets in some online shopping stores and train a model to predict the price range of our product.

 The dataset will be obtained through web scraping which is used to extract content and data from the chosen websites. The data will contain several features in a smart phone such as CPU, memory, Bluetooth, cameraâ€¦etc. We plan to use a `Linear Regression` model/algorithm to train our dataset which will predict the price range. 

 If needed, we think about compare the `Linear Regression` with other models and check the accuracy of such models. The MVP of this project will be the output of a small dataset we obtain.
